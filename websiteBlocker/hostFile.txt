Within the host file in windows you may need to add the IP address of the
website you wish to work with/block

It follwows the pattern:

IP address      Website name

This means that is you want to block the website then you put the IP you want to 
redirect to.

127.0.0.1       www.Facebook.com

Thus facebook will be re-directed to 127.0.0.1




127.0.0.1   www.facebook.com
127.0.0.1   facebook.com
127.0.0.1   www.hotmail.com
